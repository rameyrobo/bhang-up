            <p>Bhang Chocolate has been making non-medicated chocolates for years for such retail outlets as Whole Foods. We are focused on crafting Bhang’s award-winning medicated chocolate bars. At Bhang we strive to set industry taste and quality benchmarks. We are committed to remaining the established leader and to continuing to set the standards on how thing should be done. We are founded first and for most in making world class chocolate.</p>

<p>Our culinary infusion of medical marijuana begins with fairly traded Venezuelan criollo cacao and only the finest natural ingredients. Then It ends up as gourmet chocolate cannabis bars made by hand in our revolutionary laboratory-kitchen located in the heart of California.</p>
