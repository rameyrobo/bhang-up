As the sun rose over San Bernardino, CA, early-bird competitors and eager spectators could be seen amassing at the entrance to one of the largest cannabis events in the state. With over 300,000 people attending throughout the weekend, our booth welcomed visitors in large numbers Bhang style with free samples, t-shirts, bags and other swag. We couldn’t ask for a more awesome turnout and had even scored a win!</p>
