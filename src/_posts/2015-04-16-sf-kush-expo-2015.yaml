How could we not! We are so excited to be attending the city by the bay’s renowned Hemp Con. With over 300 exhibitors, experts, and collectives in attendance this weekend you can bet there will be static in the air raising hairs on the expected 50,000 visitors. Our booth will be ‘Bhangin’ with samples, swag, and giveaways while showcasing our entire line of products. And of course you can expect us competing in categories such as Best Concentrate, Best CBD Product, and Best Edible. </p>
